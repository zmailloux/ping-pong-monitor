# Ping Pong API
This application serves as a API endpoint for the PIR Sensor to hit and also previously additionally acted as the dashboard endpoint. We now redirect to the new dashboard URL on requests such as /, /login and /index. We've seperated the dashboard from the API the PIR sensor hits because we wanted the updating of the dashboard to not affect the gathering of player activity.
